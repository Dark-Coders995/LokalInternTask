# Lokal Intern Assessment App

This is a simple job listing Android application built as part of an assignment. It showcases how to build a scalable, modular application using clean architecture principles and modern Android libraries.

## âœ¨ Features

- Bottom navigation UI with **Jobs** and **Bookmarks** sections.
- **Jobs Screen** fetches data using **infinite scroll** from a remote API.
- Each job card shows:
  - Job Title
  - Location
  - Salary
  - Phone Number
- Clicking a job navigates to a **detail screen** with full information.
- Users can **bookmark** jobs to view them later in the **Bookmarks** section.
- Bookmarked jobs are saved **offline** using Room database.
- Proper UI **states** handled:
  - Loading
  - Error
  - Empty

### ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **MVVM** â€“ clean separation of View, ViewModel, and Model layers.
- **Retrofit** â€“ for API calls.
- **Room** â€“ for local storage of bookmarked jobs.
- **Hilt** â€“ for dependency injection.
- **StateFlow** â€“ for reactive UI updates.
- **Navigation Component** â€“ for handling screen navigation.
